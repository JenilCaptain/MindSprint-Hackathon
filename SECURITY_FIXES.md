# Security Fixes and Improvements Applied

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- ✅ **Updated Next.js** from 14.2.16 to 14.2.32 to fix critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Removed sensitive credentials** from version control and created `.env.example` template
- ✅ **Added rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- ✅ **Added input validation** using express-validator for all auth routes

### 2. **Dependency Management**
- ✅ **Removed conflicting dependencies**: Removed React, Svelte, and Vue dependencies that were conflicting in a Next.js project
- ✅ **Removed pnpm lockfile**: Project now consistently uses npm
- ✅ **Updated vulnerable packages**: Updated @vercel/analytics and other dependencies

### 3. **Configuration Improvements**
- ✅ **Added environment variable configuration** for frontend API URL
- ✅ **Created .env.example** for secure development setup
- ✅ **Added proper CORS configuration** with environment-based origins

### 4. **Code Quality & Security**
- ✅ **Added authentication rate limiting**: Limited login attempts to 5 per 15 minutes per IP
- ✅ **Added general rate limiting**: Limited API requests to 100 per 15 minutes per IP
- ✅ **Enhanced input validation**: Added proper validation for name, email, and password fields
- ✅ **Improved error handling**: Added validation error responses

## Remaining Minor Issues (Low Priority):

### 1. **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**
- 3 low severity vulnerabilities remain in transitive dependencies from @vercel/analytics
- These are related to cookie handling and are not critical for development
- Can be resolved by updating to a different analytics provider if needed

### 2. **Recommendations for Production**

#### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Replace these with your actual values before deployment:
MONGODB_URI=your_actual_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_strong_random_32_character_secret_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_specific_password
```

#### Additional Security Measures for Production:
1. Use HTTPS in production
2. Set up proper database indexes for performance
3. Implement logging and monitoring
4. Set up backup strategies
5. Use environment-specific JWT secrets
6. Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts

## How to Run After Fixes:

1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd Back/server
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd Front
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Or use the provided scripts**:
   ```bash
   # PowerShell
   .\start-dev.ps1
   
   # Bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

All critical security issues have been resolved and the application should now run safely in development mode.
